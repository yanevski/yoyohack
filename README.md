> What is this?

A badly written spambot.

> How does it work?

YYGF had a bad flood control mechanism - if you pressed the reply button rapidly then 5-6 posts would get through.
Then I figured I could make a spambot if I could send asynchronous AJAX requests.

> What is YYGF?

An obscure forum that had only a dozen users before it was shut down.

> Why does it look like it's written by a 13 year old?

Because it *was* written by a 13 year old. At least the latter part.
I had no idea how the code actually works I just needed something that would send a form without refreshing the page so I copied the code from a website (credits to Pukos)
This was almost a decade ago.

> What was your motivation?

Revenge + a lot of immaturity.

> Why was it shut down?

It was shut down because of a hacking attack. Not mine though.
A guy named Patrick was much more sinister in this and he hacked the forum's user database.
That's why it was shut down.

> Did they ban you?

Yes but I was granted amnesty. (spoiler: Patrick was too)

> Have you participated in any recent attacks on YYG?

No.
